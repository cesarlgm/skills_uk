 My understanding of the problem I am solving is the following. The structure in the model impose that for each education level $j$:
 \beqn
	\sum_iS_i\theta_i^j=1
 \eeqn
Let me focus on the problem of choosing the weights $\theta^j$. The problem I want to solve is choosing a vector of $\theta$ for each education level so that $\sum_iS_i\theta_i^j=1$. I find the lack of indexing of education levels in the paper confusing.

But anyways. Suppose I have chosen the scales $S_i$ already.

	\item What restrictions do I have in $\theta$? 
	\item For the low education level I am essentially completely unrestricted. Why isn't the solution to this problem trivially a ton of weight to the skill the use the most intensively and close to nothing to the rest?
