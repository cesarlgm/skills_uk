\section{Sample}
I am restricting the sample to people:
\bitem
	\item Aged 20-60.
	\item Not in the armed forces.
	\item With non-missing occupation.
	\item Non-missing educational level.
	\item At least one year of work after leaving full-time education.
\eitem

\section{Occupation cross-walks}
\bitem
	\item The occupation classification of the LFS changes every ten years.
	\item The new version of the SES/LFS provides cross-walks between the 90s - 00s - 10s classification, but the mapping is not 1-1 (e.g. some 90s codes are mapped into more than one 00s code). I address this issue as follows:
	\item \textbf{90s-00s}
	\bitem
		\item There is no cross walk available directly from the LFS. However the SES classifies observations into both the 90s and the 00s classifications.
		\item I use the SES to construct the mapping.
		\item \textbf{Issues}
		\bitem
			\item It matters at which year I look at. If I observe the SES 1997, all soc90 map into an unique soc00 category.
			\item However, when I look at 2001 the mapping is no longer unique.
			\item There are \textbf{more} soc90 codes in SES 2001 than in SES 1997.
		\eitem
		\item For now, I am using the SES 2001 to build the mapping. Main concerns with this:
		\bitem
			\item I am losing 22 jobs that were available in SES 1997.
			\item Small sample might be an issue. The main question here is: would the weights be ok?
			\item The SES 2001 gives 577 soc90-soc00 links. 31\% of those links have only 1 observation in them.
			\item 190 bsoc90 codes map uniquely into \href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/9a6xgrs32jsneuw/soc90count.txt?dl=0}{bsoc00}.
		\eitem
	\eitem
	\item \textbf{10s-00s}
	\bitem
		\item The cross walk is directly provided in the LFS.

%\section{Regarding weighting}

%\bitem
%\item The dataset comes with sampling weights.
%\item According to the documentation the weights apply to people aged 20-60 years old. Even within this sample some observations in 2006 and 2012 have missing weights. The documentation does not say why this could happen. 
%\item Without weighting, the dataset has too few mean and young people.
%\item For now, all results are weighted.

%\section{Occupations to keep}
%\item Not all occupations appear in all years. It's unclear to me if this is a result of new jobs appearing, or whether this is a result of people in this occupations not being sampled.
%\item For now I restrict everything to occupations appearing in all waves.

\section{Definition of education}
\subsection{Survey of skills and employment}
\bitem
\item I am using the variable \texttt{edlev} for the education definition.
\item This variable:
\bitem
	\item Is the only variable describing education that is available in \textbf{all} years of the wave.
	\item It harmonizes the complicated UK educational classification into roughly comparable qualifications.
\eitem
\item I recover the mapping of uk qualifications into NQF levels. The levels roughly correspond to:
\bitem
	\item \textbf{Level 4+}: professional degree, bachelor's degree or more.
	\item \textbf{Level 3}: GCE A$^*$ levels / trade apprenticeship.
	\item \textbf{Level 2}: GCSE A levels.
	\item \textbf{Level 1}: GCSE D-G levels.
	\item \textbf{Level 0}: no qualification.
\eitem
\item The recovered mapping classifies correctly all \href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/jnzx818eogoiepc/educationMapping.txt?dl=0}{but 9 observations (out of 6481)}. The incorrectly classified observations probably stem from changes in the way that the ``other" category was classified.
\item The detailed mapping can be found \href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/5cutdsc5n23vqdk/educationMapping.xlsx?dl=0}{here}.
\eitem

\subsection{Labor Force Survey}
\bitem
	\item I try to reproduce the educational classification of the SES into the LFS.
	\item I match any ``new'' categories using the classification provided in the LFS 2017 documentation. See page 107 in this \href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/zk285nssot3z5dw/lfs_user_guide_vol5_classifications2009.pdf?dl=0}{pdf} 
	\item The detailed mapping can be found in the LFS sheet in this \href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/5cutdsc5n23vqdk/educationMapping.xlsx?dl=0}{document}
\eitem 	

\subsection{Grouping educational levels}
\bitem
\item I group education levels by looking at how similar the occupational distribution between them.
\item I do this by examining:
\bitem
	\item Correlation of the employment distribution across skills.
	\item Computing the pairwise Welch indexes:
	\begin{align*}
		G_{kl}&=\frac{\sum_o(q_{ko}-\bar{q}_{o})(q_{lo}-\bar{q}_{c})/\bar{q_o}}{\sqrt{(\sum_o(q_{ko}-\bar{q}_o)^2/\bar{q}_o)(\sum_o(q_{lo}-\bar{q}_o)^2/\bar{q}_o)}}
	\end{align*}
\eitem
\item The overall pattern is:
\bitem
	\item No qualification and GCSE D-G are pretty similar and they become more similar across time.
	\item Bachelor + is an independent category in its own right.
	\item	What to do with GCSE A-C and GCE A* is less clear. 
	\bitem
		\item GCSE A-C appears to be closer to No qualification and  GCSE D-G than to GCE A*.
	\eitem
\eitem
 \item At this point I do the grouping as follows:
 \bitem 
 	\item Low education: no qualification,  GCSE D-G, and  GCSE A-C.
 	\item Medium education:  GCSE A*.
 	\item High education: Bachelor +.

\section{Boundary jobs}
	Let $s_{j}(o), j\in\{H,M,L\}$ denote the employment share of education level $j$ in occupation $o$. Denote as $p_i(o)$ the i-th employment share in occupation $o$, thus $p_1(o)=s_{H}(o)$ if high-education workers represent the largest share of employment in occupation $o$.
\bitem
	\item \textbf{Definition 1:} $o\in B_1$ iff:
	\beqns
	p_1(o)\leq R
	\eeqns
	\item \textbf{Definition 1:} $o\in B_2$ iff:
	\beqns
	\frac{p_1(o)}{p_1(o)+p_2(o)}\leq R
	\eeqns
	\item \textbf{Definition 3}: $o\in B_3$ iff:
	\beqns
		p_1(o)-p_2(o)\leq R-0.5
	\eeqns
	\item For any $R$, $B_3\subset B_2\subset B_1$

\section{Going back to SES}
\bitem
	\item I have 192 out of 332 occupations which I can track throughout the whole period.
	\item Occupations appearing only 4 times across the period could be an issue. They account for about 25\% of employment in the \href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/bzkjsuhid0z5yaf/sesPanelEmpshare.txt?dl=0}{LFS}.
	\bitem 
		\item Out of these: those not appearing in 1997 are the issue. They account for about 22\% of total employment in the LFS.
		\item Those that are missing in a year other than 1997 are probably just due to sampling. They are fairly small so I am very confident excluding them.
	\eitem
	\item Missing occupations after 1997 are probably the result of sampling error. They are generally small and account at most for 2\% of LFS employment.
	\item Crux of the issues are in the change between 1997 and 2001.
