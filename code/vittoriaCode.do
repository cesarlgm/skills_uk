sort dataset isco88 edlev

*isco88 is the occupation variable of interest because it is the one with finer categories
*edlev is the most simply coded ed variable. it corresponds to nvq uk qualification, which go from 1 to 5. 
*here, 4 level is = 4 and 5 nvq. There are other measures as well in the dataset but they are less clean

*see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Vocational_Qualification

*Level 4 is equivalent to bachelors degree
*Level 3 is post high-school education
*Level 2 would be like secondary education
*Level 1 below high-school diploma


/*
*I first perform a factor analysis for all the variables that could be considered skills/tasks. 
*What is in here is arguable. I was conservative in non excluding any of the variables, so there is info
*on how these cahracteristics/tasks/skills matter in one's job, but this was exploratory work, so it might make sense
*to take some of these out. I only show 6 fators because from previous analysis I saw only 6 factors matter.
*I also only show variables that have loadings of at least 0.4 because if lower it is likely not to be relevant for the
*definition of what the factor is. We use oblique rotation because it seems more reasonable to believe that 
*skill are not orthogonal with one another.

*After a first exploratory run, I exclude variable that have uniqueness >0.6 because this implies
*that they are not "explained" much by the factors, so they are less relevant.  I then predict the 
*values of the 6 factors.

*I attempted drawing a triangle graph with the factors obtained above, but there seemed to be too little variation.
*(obviously using a combination of the 6 factors - 1+2+3, 4+5, 6) As Costas pointed out, there might be a way in which we can 
*rescale these variables and solve the issue. I haven't tried that yet.

*I decided then to pick only one of the variables per each relevant group of 1 factor.
*2 ways to do it: 
*A) perform a factor analysis on the subgroups of relevant variables in every factor
*and pick the variable that has the highest loading in the factor component
*B) pick the variable in the subgroups of relevant variables that is most highly correlated 
*to the factor component, they are kind of very similar thought so nothing really changes (row 162)
